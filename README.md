# wp-woocommerce-demo-web
To showcase my skills in WordPress, particularly using WooCommerce, I built this very basic E-commerce website (Acoustic Guitar purchasing site)

# Highlights
- Used Astra Theme to build the site
- Used Elementor to edit the content of the site
- Added products (Guitars), and cross-checked different purchasing options like adding to cart, checking out, product filters, add discount code etc.
- Added payment method (Since I built this website on localhost, I chose cash on delivery as the payment option but on live server, we can easily add debit/credit card options)
- Edited headers and footers using Elementor
